## [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) has great docs! Start there!

## My Fave Resources (Will Add To This)

### READING
- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)  is super organized and easy to read.

- [The Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) has loads of cool examples of what you can do with NextJS! I looked at this for examples of TS & Styled-Components with Next. 
### WATCHING 
- [Crash Course from Traversy](https://youtu.be/mTz0GXj8NN0) - delightful Boston accent + really useful, easy-to-follow tutorial.

### ATTENDING
- [NextJS has its own conference!](https://nextjs.org/conf#room-j7pge) Next one is June 15, 2021! Get a ticket!

### DEPLOYMENT

I've used [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) for all my Next deployments because it's very easy, but you can deploy on anything that will allow for hosting whatever you need (like if you're using the API routes make sure your service can deploy Node/Express apps).

If you find anything cool that should be included here, just DM me!
